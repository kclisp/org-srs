* User Workflow
1. Ask for daily cards (drill)
2. Front of card is revealed
3. User thinks and then flips (press any key)
4. Back of card is revealed
5. User scores from 1 to 5
6. Card is put back into review or scheduled
7. Repeat until drill is complete

* System workflow
1. Cards ready for review are collected (review pile)
2. Each card is shown to user
3. Given user score, days-until-next-review is updated. If score is 1
   or 2, the card is put back into review, otherwise the card is taken
   out of review, and the card's next-review is updated
4. Repeat until no cards are in review

* Structure
- A card is a headline with its contents
- The headline is the front of the card
- Its content is the back of the card
- Any metadata associated with the card is a property

* Card metadata
In order to keep track of when to review a card (and how easy that
card is), certain metadata is required to be kept. These metadata are
the following:
** CURRENT-INTERVAL
Contains the number of days between when the card was last reviewed
and the current scheduled date for the card to be reviewed. Default
is 1.
** EASE
A measure of the easiness of the card. Used to multiply
current-interval. Default is 2.5, minimum is 1.3.
** NEXT-REVIEW
Contains the date of the next review.

* Spacing
Press
- 1 (Again): ease decreases by 0.2, current interval is multiplied by 0.8, and card goes back to review pile (card not scheduled)
- 2 (Hard): ease decreases by 0.15, current interval is multiplied by 1.2, and card is scheduled
- 3 (Good): current interval is multiplied by ease, and card is scheduled
- 4 (Easy): ease increases by 0.15, current interval is multiplied by ease and 1.3, and card is scheduled

For scores other than Again, the new interval is at least the old interval plus one.

** Remembering overdue cards
Additionally for Good and Easy, remembering a card past the scheduled date gives a bonus:
- Good: Half the time overdue is added to the current interval before being multiplied by ease
- Easy: The full time overdue is added to the current interval before being multiplied by ease
